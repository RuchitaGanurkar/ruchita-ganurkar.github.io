 As your intellect always want what you’ve dreamed of & if you failed to fulfill, you start reasoning in all possible ways just to give a valid reason to society & to yourself. But without giving excuses can you fail in a better way? Are you ready to prevent ordinary behavior that causes failure? Here you’re again with my writeups on a unique topic. So, guys are you prepared to rewrite opinions about downfalls? Let’s read!

Once Michael Eisner said in a 1996 speech, “Failing is good as long as it doesn’t become a habit.” it’s so suitable statement about the life you should remember. Whenever you want to change the habit which you’ve been maintaining for months, years take a lot of cognitive & manual efforts. The habit of falling in every field where you’ve performed so well doesn’t seem satisfied with your efforts, does it? But the following statement will able to shift view towards your failures. It’s about the most memorable invention often the light bulb, which purportedly took Thomas Edison’s 1,000 tries before he developed a successful prototype.“How did it feel to fail 1,000 times?” a reporter asked. “I didn’t fail 1,000 times. The light bulb was an invention with 1,000 steps.” Edison responded.

No failure is too small to be ignored or go unregarded significant explanation from Edison’s response. One thought Yes, I’ve tried, and yes, I’ve failed, but that will not stop me! I’ll try again even if I fail again can give rise to face that habit of failure again great justification from Eisner’s quote. What if you learned how to fail in a better way? can also solve many problems. Just to explain that Backett said “Trying to fail is not necessarily failing. Trying to succeed sharpens a technique, refines a strategy, narrows problem & focuses your attention on the solution.”

Not succeeding is not the same as failing, because at least it tells people to be patient for a while. You should hope for the best while planning for the worst can be the safest way to perform. Failure is not a temporary condition. Failure is not something to tolerate while focusing on the bright side. Then what failure entirely says?
What does it illustrate?

    Failure doesn’t mean that you haven’t worked hard; 
    it simply means that you need to take another approach to achieve what you want.

    If you have been knocked to the ground by failure, 
    get back on your feet and push harder to show that 
    nothing can break you down. Don’t let self-doubt hold you back.

    Failure gives you a path for redirection. 
    You get a sense of clarity everywhere you have gone wrong 
    and how to take a better path to reach where you want to be. 
    You get the ability for instant decisions.

    Failure keeps you grounded. Failure teaches you to 
    value all the right things in order to succeed. 
    You pursue a conflict between confidence & overconfidence.

    In order to achieve targets & goals, you need to 
    leave your comfort zone. Failure takes you out of 
    your comfort zone to achieve everything you want.

    Failures show you how mentally strong and capable you are. 
    Failure shows you the opportunity to correct wrong moves.

    Failure is an experience that gives a 
    person two advantages: Experience and Feedback.

Some justifications
Why do you deal with failure in life?

    The core cause can be a distraction. If you’re observing day-to-day 
    life how much time you’re spending on yourself? & 
    how much time you’re investing in things which hardly beneficial for your life?

    Some of you just haven’t taken your life responsibility. 
    It results in, you don’t know what’s happening in your life?

    Then comes your belief, you don’t believe things are possible to do. 
    So you just spend time running away from opportunities.

    Your thoughts play the most important function, 
    more you see possibilities more you feel to achieve it. 
    But deep down you think you don’t deserve what you want. 
    It shows your way towards failure.

In conclusion, the problem is that we have stories only about the failures that eventually led to success. We selectively remember the success, since it’s such a relief, and the failure goes unsung. Get up with your failure make it worthwhile for your life, try to fail in better ways. Pay attention where you went wrong & correct it in the next move.
