Hello everyone, I’m so happy to tell you which surprise gift we all have. Are you willing to know? Then have a look…But before that make a promise to yourself, this gift you’ll definitely share with others.

Life surprises us many times. We don’t know what will be in front of us within a few minutes. But we always have to make a ‘CHOICE’ which somehow to be the best for ourselves. What was your choice, what is your choice & what will be your choice to decide what will you face & how will you face it?

In terms of surprise we have one gift, we can offer it to others or can keep it i.e “HAPPINESS”. It’s not just worded it’s a vibe, vibe full of positivity & thought that warm us from inside that ‘Everything Is Going To Be Alright !! …

Every ‘Day & Night’, Every ‘Sunrise & Sunset’ leaves message for us that, there is a HOPE,’Wrong’ can be converted into ‘Right’, ‘No’ can be changed into ‘Yes’.Hope, those tears we wept alone will vanish & will bring a curve of a smile on our face. So don’t leave hope & for that very first thing we should feel from inside is our ‘Happiness’.

## FUTURE DOES HAVE IT’S NAME ” HOPE “

It’s an invisible, untouchable, unoccupied gift that should not be affected by anyone. Readers, you don’t have to pay for it, and GST also not applicable. It can be a gift coupon for others with no last date but with one referral code of ‘SHARING’. Anyone can redeem it anywhere & anytime.

We don’t need to wait for ‘Christmas’ or ‘Diwali’ at all, neither for ‘New Year’ nor for ‘Birthday Night / Morning’. We don’t need any ‘Occassion’ or ‘Party’ to experience happiness. Whether your friend tagged you in the pic or not, whether you got a good grade in exams or not, whether you’re appreciated for your work or not, whether you notice ‘Good Morning’ or ‘Good Night’ message from the most expected person it really doesn’t matter for being happy from inside.

Then what goes wrong by all of us, is that linking all the moments, situations, actions, responses made by others or by ourselves. We’ve been lined up according to different algorithms used in different situations. If we’re ready to change our programmable mind & we succeed by achieving it then definitely this illusion will end up soon. We will be able to live in ‘HAPPY-STATE’ all the time.

So, people always remember happiness stays with you all the time. It’ll be a reason for your positive vibes & for your positive thinking. No one can steal it, no one can buy it, no one can auction it, no one can destroy it. ‘Happiness’ will always be with you even you’re in the worst situation of our life. So, always choose to be ‘Happy’ from inside.

This is all about today and, I’m hoping the above words deserve your support, love & likes. Share this among your friends & stay with my writeups.

-Thank You!
