 Welcome readers, we‚Äôre here with Ruchita with the new title. Today‚Äôs blog is very special to everyone. Mentioned some extraordinary personalities & their work. Furthermore illustrated how the title refers to them. So, let‚Äôs begin..

The war we‚Äôve been facing to make our life better is never-ending. Illusionary view society, surroundings, family, friends, strangers, technology, politics have been revealing us for decades. We responses them very reasonably all the time hence it‚Äôs no end. If not we then someone else will respond to them and the history will keep reiterating the same actions. Some of the below personalities struggled the same & we‚Äôre repeating the actions like them. It influences the same result but for us, it‚Äôs awful than that effect. Because we‚Äôve none to prevent it we only have one who keeps provoking us to do such stupidity. Before time passes if such activities recognized then hopefully the result will be different. Similarly, before time slips from our hand if we learned how to use them in a good manner then also resulting output will be on our side.

So about whom I‚Äôm talking? There are two persons whom discoveries & findings have been helping us from decades. Few people know who found the encyclopedia & few people know who Lilavati was. One‚Äôs theory & another‚Äôs effect is enough under today‚Äôs title.

Let‚Äôs start with Indian mathematician Bhaskaracharya. Yes, the one who has made the world richer with great work! Once who has also worked as a philosopher & as a poet. Who‚Äôve come across us with a book called ‚ÄúLILAVATI‚Äù. Who was the first to discover gravity before Newton.

That immortal book has an interesting story behind that derived name. The actual fact is that Lilavati was his only daughter. That time also astrology & astrologer has an important contribution is someone‚Äôs birth & death. Same went with Lilavati, when she was born two of the known astrologers had cast her horoscope & predicated that stars under which she‚Äôd born were not lead her to married life. They also suggested Bhaskaracharya not to get her daughter married.

The thing here is reaching a place, but which place Bhaskaracharya wanted to reach is that she was his only daughter & he wanted her to live a happy life, then for the sake of his daughter‚Äôs happiness he pleaded with an astrologer to calculate at least one auspicious moment when stars would favor her marriage. Astrologer took four days & came out with that day. When she would reach her 25th year then only set date for wedding her marriage was possible. Lilavati was seated in the embrace of her uncle, who was to give away the bride. To determine the exact moment, when the ceremony could start, the astrologers and priests set an hourglass beside Lilavati. Lilavati gazed at the floating cup from time to time, to see how near she was approaching the propitious moment.

After quite some time had passed, one of the astrologers looked into the hourglass and cried ‚ÄúAlas! the propitious moment has come and gone‚Äù! He lifted the vessel from the water. No liquid had entered the vessel and therefore no liquid had flown through the cavity. As Lilavati sitting in the embrace of her uncle, in her anxiety, had bent several times over the cup, a pearl had dropped from her ornaments and blocked the opening through which the fluid should have passed. And now the auspicious hour had gone unnoticed and it was forever too late!

To console the unhappy Lilavati, to whom normal pleasures of married life were denied forever, Bhaskaracharya promised to work upon a book in mathematics and name it after her! And he finally reached one place where he & his wisdom belong.

This person has set radical philosophical ideas about materialism with very famous quotes ‚ÄúMan will never be free until the last king is strangled with the entrails of the last priest‚Äù.

In the  mid-1700‚Äôs France, there lived an artist and writer facing poverty. His name was Denis Diderot. The son of a successful craftsman. He obtained a Master of Arts in philosophy but Diderot dreamed of becoming a writer. At the age of 21, he dropped out of school. His father disowned him because of well-established family background and Diderot lived a scrappy bohemian lifestyle for the next thirty years. Here comes how satisfaction plays with our minds. He enjoyed this simple life. His robes were plain & comfortable. He has a home with a tiny writing desk and a tattered straw chair. He spent his evenings at his battered desk under candlelight.

Diderot wrote novels and critiques of the French government, and article by article, book by book. This way he wrote Encyclopedia, one of the most comprehensive encyclopedias of the era despite his lack of disposable income, he came up with an impressive collection of books.

From next how Diderot Effect means & how it affects you‚Äôll read. His ideas impressed the Russian Empress Catherine the Great. In 1763, Catherine the Great purchased his personal library, paying an enormous sum for his collection because she learned Diderot needs financial help. By requesting him to keep those books at his home she offered him a generous annual salary to act as the collection‚Äôs caretaker. She paid his salary for the next 50 years upfront. And bravo! Diderot, age 52, became a wealthy man.

He thought there wouldn‚Äôt be any harm if he spent some money just to indulge himself. Diderot bought himself a fine scarlet robe. One night he noticed that ugly chair & thought how could he sit in an ugly chair while wearing a beautiful robe? What if the straw tore the robe? Diderot replaced it with an armchair in Moroccan leather. Again he replaced desk it with a gleaming new wooden table. He bought a finely-crafted bureau with drawers with a pile of paperwork. Piece by piece, Diderot replaced every item in his home, until he lived in the splendor that reflected his scarlet robe.

The Diderot Effect is a term that describes the tendency for purchases to trigger additional purchases.

In a similar way, we work specifically saying our behavior works. For the sake of her daughter‚Äôs happiness and his satisfaction he came up with the idea about books & nothing is different for another person. For the sake of his good life, he couldn‚Äôt find another way & came up with an effect. Everyone wants to be satisfied with their own efforts & want to reach a place where no one without them stays. But during this race, we forget our destination & we miss our target. After fulfilling jar with sufficient water we keep struggling with our results & think üí≠ it‚Äôs not enough yet. Everybody likes to stand in a sphere of triumphs, comparing our previous results that are also fine but what goes wrong is not reaching our satisfactory level, because it always affected by our surroundings. So, it‚Äôs better to know which is our place?

Hopefully, you‚Äôll get to know about your place very soon. This is all I want to share with you and, I‚Äôm hoping the above words deserve your support, love & likes. Share this among your friends & stay with my writeups for the upcoming write-up.

-Thank You!
